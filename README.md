# ðŸ§  AI Agents in LangGraph
This project is part of my learning journey in the AI Agents in LangGraph course. It explores the fundamentals of agentic workflows and how to build intelligent agents using LLMs and LangGraph.  

# ðŸ”§ What I Did
Introduced to **Agents** and **Agentic Workflows**  
Built an **AI Agent** from scratch using Python and a Language Model (LLM)  
Rebuilt the same agent using **LangGraph components** to modularize and manage workflows  
Explored **Agentic Search** and its powerful capabilities in goal-driven execution  

# ðŸš€ Tech Stack
Python  
LangGraph  
OpenAI LLMs (or any supported LLM)
